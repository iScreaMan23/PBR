<div class="content ">
  <h2 id="ways-to-help-without-leaving-your-home">Ways to help without leaving your home:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Source and purchase gear to outfit protesters</li>
<li>Give emotional support to protesters, either informally to friends or, if you’re a therapist, donate sessions</li>
<li>DON’T USE LOUD EQUIPMENT LIKE LAWNMOWERS BEFORE NOON. A lot of people are effectively working third shift right now, let them get their sleep</li>
<li>Be a protester’s contact person. Have a designated check-in time and, if they miss it, have a plan ready for how you’ll look for them to determine if they’ve been arrested, injured, or kidnapped</li>
<li>Make shields to give away</li>
<li>If you are a lawyer, there’s TONS of pro bono help needed—for people arrested, protest-related orgs trying to get incorporated, support for people and orgs being targeted for harassment and intimidation, and more</li>
<li>*Twitter comms! Boost important things, particularly by Black people. Make it easy for the people on the ground to see important up-to-date info</li>
<li>*Social media support: spread accurate information, fact-check things that seem suspect, keep people on message (Black lives matter!)</li>
<li>Here’s a charged one—has one of your relatives or otherwise close people been brainwashed by right-wing media, conspiracy groups, etc.? Try to reach them. For everyone’s sake.</li>
<li>Call and put pressure on local politicians</li>
<li>Put pressure on companies that are working with the police and feds—for example, Marriott and Enterprise</li>
<li>Make art to support the movement—signs, images that inform people about abolition, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ways-to-help-without-going-to-protest-area">Ways to help without going to protest area:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make food and bring it to friends who are out protesting</li>
<li>Hit thrift stores and yard sales to look for used gear like helmets, goggles, protective padding, umbrellas, traffic cones (spray paint helmets black)</li>
<li>Gather black clothing and shoes from thrift stores, yard sales, neighbors passing stuff along; get it downtown so people can replace their bloc</li>
<li>If you are a massage therapist or body worker, donate work on protesters—there’s some real unhappy bodies out there</li>
<li>Offer free childcare to a parent going out to protest</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ways-to-help-onsite-but-not-right-on-the-front-lines">Ways to help onsite but not right on the front lines</h2>
<ul>
<li>Support Riot Ribs in the early hours so they can get much-needed sleep</li>
<li>Provide car or bike support to marches (this can be dangerous)</li>
<li>Drop off food and supplies to be passed out (maybe some of the people doing things in the above sections could use a runner for their donations!)</li>
<li>Be ready in a car to pick people up and take them to safety</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you’re doing social media and comms work, you should be very careful what narratives and voices you are boosting, that you’re promoting correct information, and that you’re not sharing things that could be harmful to protesters. As an easy example, don’t boost livestreams that show protesters’ faces. Avoid accidentally boosting things from right-wing sources. Ideally, find someone else who is already doing this work and ask for advice on how to do it ethically and safely.
And an important reminder. There’s a lot of support turning up this week in response to the brutality of the federal officers. That’s good and important and wonderful. AND. The feds are not the reason we’re out here. If they went home, we would NOT BE DONE. We would just focus back on the original reason we were out there—defunding PPB. The feds are scary in a different way for a variety of reasons, not least the fascism they represent, but it was PPB who escalated attacks against protesters week after week until the feds showed to back them up.</li>
