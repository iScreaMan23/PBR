## Repo Root directory
### config.toml
This is where you define stuff for the home page (e.g. the image used for home button and the image on home page) as well as the menu items that items that are in the top bar.  Right now I moved all the defaults to RTFM so they can be referenced for building things.

### content
This is the really important boi.  It's where all of the text pages are located.  Its structure is what generates the site map. Look inside it any you'll understand how the site is structured from the file structure here.

## index.md vs. _index.md
make sure you follow the right convention because reversing these will screw up formatting.  Most pages should be index.md.
